## 💻 Network probe protocols

Choose the highest-level protocol that represents the service you need to monitor. An ICMP reply only confirms that a
host answers echo requests, while a protocol-aware probe also confirms that the expected application is responding
correctly.

After selecting a protocol in the Add Ping Services dialog, enter its target in the format shown below.

| Protocol      | Target and default                                                                  | What NetSonar checks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Choose it when                                                                                                                                        |

| **NTP**       | `host` or `host:port`; default `123/UDP`                                            | Sends an NTP client request and validates the response mode, version, synchronization state, stratum, timestamps, and request correlation.                                                                                                                                               | You need to confirm that a time server is synchronized and returning valid NTP responses.                                                             |
| **HTTP**      | `http://host/path` or `https://host/path`; HTTP is assumed if the scheme is omitted | Sends a GET request and completes after receiving the response headers without downloading the body.

| **WebSocket** | `ws://host/path` or `wss://host/path`; defaults `80` and `443`                      | Performs the WebSocket HTTP upgrade and requires the connection to reach the `Open` state. Paths, custom ports, and TLS through `wss://` are supported.                                                                                                                                  | You need to validate a WebSocket endpoint rather than only its underlying HTTP or TCP listener.                                                       |
| **SSH**       | `host` or `host:port`; default `22/TCP`                                             | Sends a NetSonar SSH 2.0 identification, tolerates permitted server pre-banner lines, and requires a valid `SSH-2.0-` server identification.

Custom ports such as `587` work when the server sends its greeting before STARTTLS.          |
| **IMAP**      | `host` or `host:port`; defaults `143/TCP`, with implicit TLS on `993/TCP`           | Requires an OK or PREAUTH greeting, sends a tagged CAPABILITY command, and validates both the capability data and successful tagged completion. Port `993` negotiates TLS with certificate and hostname validation before the IMAP exchange. It does not issue STARTTLS or authenticate. | You need to validate a cleartext or implicit-TLS IMAP listener without accessing a mailbox.                                                           |
| **MQTT**      | `host` or `host:port`; default `1883/TCP`                                           | Sends an MQTT 3.1.1 CONNECT packet with a randomized client ID and clean session, then requires an accepted CONNACK response.

| **STUN**      | `host` or `host:port`; default `3478/UDP`                                           | Sends a Binding request and validates the response type, declared length, magic cookie, transaction ID, attribute framing, and mapped address.                                                                                                                                           | You need to validate a STUN server or diagnose UDP and NAT traversal availability.                                                                    |
| **SIP**       | `host` or `host:port`; default `5060/UDP`                                           | Sends an unauthenticated OPTIONS request, correlates Via branch, Call-ID, and CSeq fields, ignores provisional responses, and requires a successful final response.                                                                                                                      | You need to monitor a SIP server, PBX, proxy, or VoIP endpoint that accepts OPTIONS over UDP.                                                         |

For text-list imports, use `icmp://`, `tcp://`, `udp://`, `tls://`, `dns://`, `ntp://`, `ssh://`, `smtp://`, `imap://`,
`mqtt://`, `stun://`, and `sip://` to identify non-HTTP protocols. HTTP and WebSocket entries retain their normal
`http://`, `https://`, `ws://`, or `wss://` URLs. Examples:

```text
icmp://router.local
tcp://database.local:5432
udp://service.local:9000
tls://service.example.com:443
dns://1.1.1.1
ntp://time.cloudflare.com
https://example.com/health
wss://example.com/events
ssh://server.local
smtp://mail.example.com:25
imap://mail.example.com
mqtt://broker.local:1883
stun://stun.example.com
sip://pbx.local
```

The Add Ping Services dialog provides a separate public-host import for TLS, DNS, NTP, HTTP, WebSocket, SSH, SMTP, IMAP,
MQTT, STUN, and SIP. DNS and NTP use specialized provider catalogues; the other protocols use the shared public-host
catalogue. These endpoints are connectivity examples and external-service checks, so availability and access policies
remain controlled by each provider.

## 🛰️ Network scanner

The scanner discovers the hosts of a target network, then optionally probes their ports. The target defaults to the
IPv4 networks of the active interfaces; manually typed targets are remembered. Networks wider than `/16` are never
offered as automatic targets, and a target that expands beyond the configured host limit is rejected.

Two engines are available:

| Engine | Requires | Host discovery | Port scan | Extras |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **nmap** | nmap installed and enabled in the options | `nmap -sn` | `-Pn` with `-sT` (or `-sS` when elevated), `--open`, top 100/top 1000/all/custom ports | Service and version detection (`-sV`), UDP (`-sU`) and OS detection (`-O`) when elevated, live progress and ETA, raw XML report |
| **Built-in** | Nothing | ICMP sweep plus the operating system neighbour (ARP) cache, so hosts that drop ICMP are still found | TCP connect probes over the same port presets | Service names from the well-known port catalogue; no versions, UDP, or OS detection |

Port scans always run with `-Pn`, because the hosts are already known to be up; without it an unprivileged nmap
repeats host discovery and can report no ports at all. An elevated scan is launched through the bundled gsudo on
Windows, `pkexec` on Linux, and `osascript` on macOS, so its output is still captured; only macOS delivers that output
at the end instead of streaming it. MAC addresses and vendors are only reported by an elevated or
root scan; vendors missing from nmap output are resolved from the `nmap-mac-prefixes` database when nmap is installed.

Host discovery is a live probe, so a device in power save, a slow responder, or an unprivileged scan that can only
use TCP connect pings can be missed by one run without having left the network. A missed host therefore stays in the
table, flagged as gone, for three scans before it is dropped, and an unprivileged nmap discovery is completed with the
operating system neighbour (ARP) cache — which also supplies the MAC address and vendor that such a scan cannot see.
An elevated scan skips that merge, because it ARP-pings by itself.

Each scan is stored and compared against the previous scan of the same target, so new hosts, hosts that disappeared,
and hosts whose open ports changed are flagged in the grid and reported in a toast. Results can be exported to JSON or
CSV, and the raw nmap report can be saved. An automatic rescan interval turns the page into a passive network monitor.

Selected hosts can be imported into monitoring. Importing a host creates an ICMP probe; importing its open ports maps
each port to the closest probe, for example `22` to SSH, `443` to an HTTPS probe, `53` to DNS, `1883` to MQTT, and
anything unmapped to a TCP probe.

## 📊 Response-time charts

Selecting one service displays its latency history, failure markers, rolling average over the latest 10 successful
samples, and statistics for the current reply, P50 median, P95, jitter, and loss. The chart supports 50, 100, and
250-sample windows, the configured cache size, or all retained replies. Automatic scale emphasizes typical latency while
marking values above the visible range; a full scale includes every displayed value.

Selecting multiple services switches to a comparison chart with a row for each host and markers for minimum, average,
current, maximum, and failure states. Hovering a row shows the consolidated values, loss, and latest reply status for
that host.

The graph can be frozen without stopping probes and opened in a separate window. Main and pop-out controls change the
sample window, scale, and enabled state of all graphed services. The pop-out **Graph options** section also applies
probe interval and timeout changes to the current selection.

# ⚙️ Run arguments

NetSonar can be run with the following arguments:

- `--portable [level]`: Run in portable mode, configurations are saved near the executable. Use level to specify the
  directory level, e.g. `0` for the current directory, `1` for the parent directory, etc.
  - `NetSonar.exe --portable` will save the configuration in the same directory as the executable.
- `--profile-path <path>`: Specify the path to the profile file.
  - `NetSonar.exe --profile-path D:\NetSonarConfigs` will use the profile file at the specified path.
  - `NetSonar.exe --profile-path NetSonarConfigs` will use the profile path relative to the executable path.

Note: Both `--portable` and `--profile-path` can be used together, but `--profile-path` will take precedence if both are
specified.
